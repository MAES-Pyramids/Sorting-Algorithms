# kruskals Algorithm
kruskals Algorithm is implemented to create an MST from an undirected, weighted, and connected graph.
The edges are sorted in ascending order of weights and added one by one till all the vertices are included in it.
It is a Greedy Algorithm as the edges are chosen in increasing order of weights. No cycle is created in this algorithm.

### Advantages of Kruskal’s Algorithm:
- It is easy to implement
- It offers a good control over the resulting MST


### Application of Kruskal’s Algorithm:
- Used to make electrical wiring layout
- Used to make LAN connection
- A network of pipes for drinking water or natural gas.
- Single-link Cluster.
